Development History
-------------------

The original version was developed by Chad E. Brown (mathgate.info)
and released under an MIT license in 2014. In 2015 the Qeditas
developers created this fork of Egal to support the creation of
Qeditas theories, signatures and documents. The original version of
Egal can still be found at https://mathgate.info/egal along with some
documentation. Since there are some differences between the forks, the
documentation available at mathgate.info is in some cases incompatible
with this fork. However, if one adds the command line argument
"-polyexpand" then the egal executable will for the most part behave
like the original mathgate version. Most of the new code written to
support Qeditas is in the src/qeditas directory.
